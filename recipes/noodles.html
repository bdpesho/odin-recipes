    <h2>Learn how to spice up your instant noodles and make them better</h2>
    <p>Ramen Noodles aren't exactly the most nutritious meal.</p>
    <p>However, there are times where a pack of noodles and a few other ingredients is all you have in kitchen.</p>
    <p>You'd be surprised how easy it is to make them <em>much</em> better by simply adding a few extra things on top.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A packet of Ramen Noodles</li>
        <li>Chickpeas (canned, or in a jar)</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs (Any that you have)</li>
        <li>Salt, Pepper, Paprika</li>
        <li>A lime, or a lemon, or lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 500ml of water in a Kettle or in your Microwave</li>
        <li>While the water is heating up, place the packet of Ramen Noodles in a bowl, and squeeze your lime over it. Flip over, and do the other side as well.</li>
        <li>Add your salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Avoid using the small packet that comes with your noodles.</li>
        <li>Take your chickpeas, and drain them of all water. Once done, place them around your noodles.</li>
        <li>Since your water should be done by now, pour it slowly and evenly inside the bowl.</li>
        <li>Finally, take any fresh or dried herbs you may have lying around, and dumb them on top.</li>
        <li>Cover your bowl with a dish for 3-5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
